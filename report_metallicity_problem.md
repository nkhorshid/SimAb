1-The metallicity in chem.py is calculated using natural logaritm no log10.
	This would lead to higher values of metallicity compared to the actual values.
	This does not afffect the super and sub solar metallicity conclussion.
q: do we take this into account in the fortran version?

2- Does different ways of calculating metallicity affect the results?
